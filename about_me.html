        <h1>Hello, my name is Phuong Thanh Nguyen.</h1>
        <p>Last May-June, I went on a trip to South Korea and Japan with my childhood best friend. We had planned this trip for quite a while and had decided that post-graduation was the perfect time to make it happen. At first, things felt overwhelming because we were jetlagged and unfamiliar with the langauge. However, the trip was an overall success. We were able to navigate the cities smoothly with our limited Korean and Japanese from watching kdramas and anime, we ate lots of good foods, and we had an amazing time exploring the many fashion and beauty products.</p>
        <p>If I could have a pet, it would be ..
            <ul>
                <li>a goldfish named Fishy. </li>
                <li>a samoyed named Fluff.</li>
                <li>a ragdoll cat named Lemon.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>My favorite restaurant is <a target="blank" href="https://joyyee.com">JOY YEE</a>. It's located in Chinatown, Illinois. The first bite was just right. I wouldn't say it's the "best" food that I've every had, but everything about the flavoring felt so comforting and suitable to my taste. I've been back a few times and every time I order a bone marrow soup and a short rib with garlic fried rice. I love that they make basic recipes feel so elevated. The menu selection is probably the largest one that I see, with over 200 items. My favorite part of Joy Yee is that they have a range of cuisines -- from Vietnamese to Chinese to Korean, this makes it easy to be able to try different kinds of foods!</p>
        <p><img src="images/banhbotloc.jpg" align="left" height="100">My favorite food of all time is banh bot loc. It is Vietnamese tapioca dumpling filled with pork, shrimp, and mushroom. I like it dip it in nuoc nam, which is fish sauce.</p>
